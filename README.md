Combined Google Search
====================================

DokuWiki's search is great, but it does not order search results by relevance. Google does. Why not combine the results of DokuWiki with the ones from Google then?
Here we go! This plugin hooks into the DokuWiki search and queries Google for your search word. It the combines both results sets so that Googles matches come first and internal ones right after.
